✅forEach
➡️The forEach method in JavaScript is a built-in method of arrays that allows you to iterate over each element in the array. 

➡️It takes a callback function as a parameter, which will be executed for each element in the array. 

➡️The callback function itself can take up to three parameters: 
the current element, the index of the current element, and the array itself.


✅Map
➡️In this example, the map() method is called on the numbers array, and a callback function is passed as an argument. 

➡️The callback function takes a single argument, number, and returns its square.

 ➡️The map() method returns a new array, squares, with the transformed elements. 

 ➡️The original numbers array remains unchanged.
